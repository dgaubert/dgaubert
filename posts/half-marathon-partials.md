I finished my first half marathon ever. Along with 40,000 other runners, the
[Rock n Roll Madrid](https://rocknrollmadridrun.com/) race is super crowded but
enjoyable. Running through the streets of your town is a gift. Live music, lots
of people supporting athletes, and nicely organized amenities for runners once
the race is finished. I don't usually like to run long distances, but once a
year doesn't hurt, so I think I'm going to repeat in 2025.
