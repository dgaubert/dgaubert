Next Sunday (April 28, 2024), I'm going to run the
[Madrid half marathon](https://rocknrollmadridrun.com/). Despite it being my
first attempt at such a distance, I feel confident in finishing it because it's
been three years since I've been training regularly. In 2021, I started by
running just 5 km three or four times a week. Once my muscles and tendons were
strong enough, I began running longer distances (10 to 12 km). Last week, I ran
my longest distance ever: 16 km, along the well-known route "La Tapia", and I
felt really good. Two and a half years ago, I bought a sports watch to measure
my training. Although I don't have any specific goals for the race next Sunday,
just to finish it, here are my records:

| Distance |    Time |
| :------- | ------: |
| 1km      |    3:50 |
| 5km      |   22:39 |
| 10km     |   50:11 |
| 15km     | 1:34:32 |

As I trained for shorter distances many more times than longer ones, my records
are worse for 10 and 15 km. After the half-marathon, my next goal is to run 10
km in 45 minutes.
