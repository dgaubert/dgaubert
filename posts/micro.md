I love to learn by doing. I've been following the progress of [Deno](https://deno.com/) from the very beginning because I'm a big fan of [Ryan Dahl](https://tinyclouds.org/)'s work since [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). A blog is the perfect use case for [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) with [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/), and this is the right moment to give it a try. As a software engineer who has spent most of my career working on the backend side, my goal is to improve my frontend skills. I've learned modern frameworks lately, such as [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [React](https://react.dev/), so Fresh is not unfamiliar to me as it uses [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) under the hood. However, I still struggle with designing usable and simple UIs and dealing with CSS.
